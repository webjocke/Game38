# Game38
A 2D fighting game programmed in c++ and SFML.

## Why?
This project was a assignment for the TDP005 course. [Official Course Website](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDP005/).

## How to run
Sorry, you are on your own here. All the gamefiles are in the 'game' folder and you need to compile all the cpp files to get an executable. Also you need to have gcc and sfml installed.
